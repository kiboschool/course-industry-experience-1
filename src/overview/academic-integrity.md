# Academic Integrity

When you turn in any work that is graded, you are representing that the work is
your own. Copying work from another student or from an online resource and
submitting it is _plagiarism_. Using generative AI tools such as ChatGPT to help
you understand concepts (i.e., as though it is your own personal tutor) is
valuable.  However, you should not submit work generated by these tools as
though it is your own work.  Remember, the activities we assign are your
opportunity to prove to yourself (and to us) that you understand the concepts.
Using these tools to generate answers to assignments may help you in the
short-term, but not in the long-term.  

As a reminder of Kibo's academic honesty and integrity policy: Any student found
to be committing academic misconduct will be subject to disciplinary action
including dismissal.

Disciplinary action may include:

- Failing the assignment
- Failing the course
- Dismissal from Kibo
