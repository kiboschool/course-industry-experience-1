## Course Description

Industry Experience is a form of experiential learning that will let you apply your academic knowledge in a professional context. You will work to build software that meets the needs of a professional organization by completing either:

- An approved internship, or
- an open-source project

During your industry experience, you will work on tasks that meet the needs of your sponsoring organization. Whether you undertake an internship or open-source collaboration, your industry experience must include significant, substantial computer science.

For students contributing to an open-source project, you will submit daily stand-up updates and meet regularly with your technical mentor. At the end of the term, you must obtain written feedback from you organization supervisor. You will also submit a final report which describes the problem statement, approaches/methods used, deliverables, and skills you gained.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of the course, you will:

- Cultivate your professional network, and use your network to aid in job searching
- Apply academic knowledge and skills in new professional settings
- Demonstrate the ability to cope effectively with ambiguous and unfamiliar situations
- Develop interpersonal and professional skills to successfully transition to work
- Reflect on your personal skills, and identify opportunities for further development
