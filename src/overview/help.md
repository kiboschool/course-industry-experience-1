# Getting Help

If you have any trouble understanding the concepts or are stuck on a problem, reach out for help!

Below are the different ways to get help in this class.

## Discord Channel

The first place to go is always the course's help channel on Discord. Share your
question there so that your Instructor and your peers can help as soon as we
can. Peers should jump in and help answer questions (see the Getting and Giving
Help sections for some guidelines).

## Message your Instructor via Email

If your question doesn't get resolved within 24 hours on Discord, you can
reach out to your instructors directly. Email is the preferred method for reaching out, and should include both instructors. 

## Office Hours

There will be weekly office hours with your Instructor and your TA.  Please make
use of them!

## Tips on Asking Good Questions

Asking effective questions is a crucial skill for any computer science student.
Here are some guidelines to help structure questions effectively:

1. **Be Specific:**
   - Clearly state the problem or concept you're struggling with.
   - Avoid vague or broad questions. The more specific you are, the easier it is
     for others to help.

2. **Provide Context:**
   - Include relevant details about your environment, programming language,
     tools, and any error messages you're encountering.
   - Explain what you're trying to achieve and any steps you've already taken to
     solve the problem.

3. **Show Your Work:**
   - If your question involves code, provide a minimal, complete, verifiable,
     and reproducible example (a "MCVE") that demonstrates the issue.
   - Highlight the specific lines or sections where you believe the problem
     lies.

4. **Highlight Error Messages:**
   - If you're getting error messages, include them in your question.
     Understanding the error is often crucial to finding a solution.

5. **Research First:**
   - Demonstrate that you've made an effort to solve the problem on your own.
     Share what you've found in your research and explain why it didn't fully
     solve your issue.

6. **Use Clear Language:**
   - Clearly articulate your question. Avoid jargon or overly technical terms if
     you're unsure of their meaning.
   - Proofread your question to ensure it's grammatically correct and easy to
     understand.

7. **Be Patient and Respectful:**
   - Be patient while waiting for a response.
   - Show gratitude when someone helps you, and be open to feedback.

8. **Ask for Understanding, Not Just Solutions:**
   - Instead of just asking for the solution, try to understand the underlying
     concepts. This will help you learn and become more self-sufficient in
     problem-solving.

9. **Provide Updates:**
    - If you make progress or find a solution on your own, share it with those
      who are helping you. It not only shows gratitude but also helps others who
      might have a similar issue.

Remember, effective communication is key to getting the help you need both in
school and professionally. Following these guidelines will not only help you in
receiving quality assistance but will also contribute to a positive and
collaborative community experience.

### Screenshots

It’s often helpful to include a screenshot with your question. Here’s how:

- **Windows:** press the Windows key + Print Screen key
  - the screenshot will be saved to the Pictures > Screenshots folder
  - _alternatively: press the Windows key + Shift + S to open the snipping tool_
- **Mac:** press the Command key + Shift key + 4
  - it will save to your desktop, and show as a thumbnail
