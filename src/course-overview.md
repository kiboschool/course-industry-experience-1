## What you'll learn

This course will help you apply, interview for, and succeed in roles in the software engineering industry.

Industry Experience is a form of experiential learning that will let you apply your academic knowledge in a professional context. You will work to build software that meets the needs of a professional organization by completing either 
- An approved internship
- A product studio or open-source project

The course is broken up into two parts. 

#### Part 1: Preparing for Industry Experience
During the first part of the course, you will refine your personal brand, and craft effective resumes, LinkedIn profiles and portfolios. You will learn to communicate effectively in behavioral interviews, including how to conduct company and role research, and how to succinctly answer questions and share you background. You will also learn to prepare for technical interviews. Key skills include the ability to walk an interviewer through one’s thought process, craft code on a whiteboard or document, and identify opportunities for improvement in one’s work.  Finally, you will learn to prepare to onboard to development job, and understand how to effectively navigate large codebases and organizations to make valuable contributions.  

#### Part 2: Suceeding during Industry Experience
During your industry experience, you will work on tasks that meet the needs of your sponsoring organization. Whether you undertake an internship, product studio or open-source collaboration, your industry experience must include significant, substantial computer science.

In addition to building your project, you will submit bi-weekly written reflections on your personal goals, challenges, and team feedback. At the end of the term, you must obtain written feedback from you organization supervisor.  You will also submit a final report which describes the problem statement, approaches/methods used, deliverables, and skills you gained. Industry Experience culminates in a final presentation which is shared as a public blog post.
