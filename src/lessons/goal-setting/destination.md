Now that you have reflected on your purpose, it is time to set goals and create systems for success.  As you may recall from <a href="https://optimizing-your-learning.vercel.app/optimizing-your-learning/building-your-learning-toolkit/habits.html" target="_blank"> Optimizing Your Learning</a>, setting goals _and_ creating systems is critical for success. Industry experience is a highly self-directed journey, and you will need to create a system for success. 


## Setting Goals

Although goals are not sufficient for success, they are necessary! As you embark on your industry experience, you should set goals for what you hope to accomplish.

As the video asserts:
- Goals give us momentum to push through the adversities we experience while chasing our dreams
- The best goals are SMARTER, i.e., 
  - Specific, so that you can quantify whether or not you've hit the goal
  - Measurable, so that you can track it over time 
  - Actionable, by beginning with a doable verb
  - Relatable, and realistic for your current situaton
  - Time-bound, so you are forced to take action toward it in a specific timeframe
  - Evaluate your progress regularly, and read them at least weekly
  - Reward yourself for hitting milestones

### Create your goals

In the assignment for this lesson, you will need to submit your learning goals and preferences for industry experience. To help you identify your goals, 

#### (1) Create a new Google doc (type "doc.new" into your browser) to use for brainstorming

#### (2) For each question below, set a timer fo 5 minutes, then list down as many goals as you can think of. 

1. What are you technical learning goals? How do you want your industry experience to improve your technical skills and build on what you have learned in your classes?
2. What are you human skills development goals? How do you wnat your industry experience help you develop the employability skills (e.g. communication, teamwork, time management, planning, etc.)?
3. What are your personal development goals? How will your industry experience help you to grow as a person, develop your brand, and build your network? What do you want to be known for?


### Prioritize your goals

Now that you have a list of goals, it is time to reduce and prioritize. Reduce and prioritize each list of goals until you have 3-5 remaining. To prioritize, consider the following:

- **Impact:** which of these is most important to you, and how does achieving them align with your values and overall objectives? Which goals have the potential to have the greatest impact on your learning or career?
- **Timeline:** are some goals more time-sensitive than others? 
- **Feasibility:** prioritize goals that are most achievable with the resources and support available to you
- **Trade-offs:** consider the trade-offs between different goals

## Creating Systems

### What systems do you need to do well in Industry Experience?

Industry experience is largely self-paced. While there are deadlines along the way, YOU will need to determine what to do and when. Go back to your goal setting document, and answer the following questions:

#### (1) What changes, if any do you need to make to your physical or social environment?
Do you need to better optimizie your study environment to enable you to do well in interviews? Should you consider working from a library or shared study space? Should you form a study group with peers to practice interviews, and give each other feedback?

#### (2) What changes, if any, do you need to make to your study approach?
Are there certain habits (e.g., procrastination) that you may need to change to secure an experience on time? Are there new habits (e.g., reading technical blogs) that might help you better prepare and succeed at work?

#### (3) What search strategy fits well with your personality and circumstances?
- What types of companies are the right fit? What do you enjoy or dislike? Though you may want to work at your dream company now, you may need to have a few years of experience and education under your belt to qualify. 
- What environment do you need to work well? For example, if you do not have access to a quiet and reliable working environment, you may want to prioritize opportunities that have an office over remote roles.
- What type of work can you take on? For example, if you are working or in school full-time, it may not be reaslitic for you to take on a full-time industry experience if you won't be available during traditional work hours.
