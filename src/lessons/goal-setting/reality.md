  🗣 **“The goal you set must be challenging. At the same time, it should be realistic and attainable, not impossible to reach. It should be challenging enough to make you stretch, but not so far that you break.”** <br>

## Getting your priorities right

Now that you have figured out what you REALLY want, the next step is to determine if what you want is REALISTIC. You need to identify which of your goals are within reach based on their outcomes, your environment and your ability to achieve them. 

Setting unrealistic goals can lead to frustration, disappointment, and a lack of motivation. If you set goals that are too difficult or impossible to achieve, you may become discouraged and give up on them entirely, which can hinder your progress and prevent you from achieving success.

When you set realistic goals, you are more likely to achieve them, which can boost your confidence and motivation. Realistic goals are ones that you can attain with the resources and abilities available to you, given the constraints of your situation. By setting goals that are challenging but achievable, you can experience the satisfaction of making progress towards your objectives and be motivated to continue working towards them.

Therefore, it is important to set goals that are realistic and attainable to ensure that you can achieve them and maintain a positive mindset while working towards them.

In order to determine whether your goals are realistic you should:

- Evaluate your current resources: Assess the resources you have available, such as time, money, and skills, to determine if they are sufficient to achieve your goal.
- Consider your past experiences: Think about similar goals you have set in the past and whether or not you were able to achieve them. This can help you assess your ability to achieve the new goal.
- Research the goal: Gather information about the goal and the steps required to achieve it. This can help you identify any potential obstacles or challenges that may arise.
- Break the goal down into smaller steps: Divide the goal into smaller, more manageable tasks. This can help you assess the feasibility of the goal and determine if it is achievable within a specific time frame.
- Get feedback: Share your goal with others and get feedback from them. This can provide you with different perspectives on the goal and help you identify any potential roadblocks.
- Make adjustments: Based on your evaluation, adjust the goal as needed. You may need to make the goal more specific, adjust the timeline, or break it down into smaller tasks.

By taking these steps, you can determine if your goals are realistic and make any necessary adjustments to ensure that you are setting yourself up for success.

  

## Quantitative vs. qualitative research
Two main types of UX research methods are quantitative and qualitative.

### Quantitative research 
Quantiative UX research collects and analyzes numerical data. This can include surveys, A/B testing, usage logs, or other methods that provide data for statistical analysis. Quantitative research is useful to 
- Generate data from a large sample size
- Make generalizations about a large population
- Test hypotheses and identify trends or patterns in user behavior 

Some questions a researcher might answer with quantiative research include:
- How many active users does the product have each day or each month?
- What share of people find the call to action on the page?
- What is the average satisfaction level of users with the product or service?

### Qualitative research
Qualitative research is less focused on collecting and analyzing numerical data. Instead, the goal of qualitative research is to understand the underlying reasons behind user behavior and preferences, and  explore the subjective experiences of users. This type of research is often used to:
- Identify trends or patterns that may not be immediately apparent from numerical data
- Gain a deeper understanding of user motivations and behaviors

Qualitative research typically involves conducting interviews, focus groups, observations, or other activities that allow researchers to probe users' thoughts and experiences in greater detail. Qualitative research often involves smaller sample sizes and is used to generate detailed insights into user behavior and preferences.




## Attitudinal vs. behaviorial research

Another set of research methods is attitudinal vs. behaviorial. The difference in these two approaches draws from the insight that what people say and believe (their attitudes) are often different from what they actually do (their behavior). To _build the right thing_, it's important to understand both what users believe and how they behave.

### Attitudinal research 
Attitudinal research aims to understand the attitudes and beliefs of a user. It typically involves conducting surveys, interviews, or other methods that allow researchers to explore people's attitudes and beliefs in greater detail. This type of research is often used to:
- Identify potential problems or issues with a product or service
- Gauge the effectiveness of marketing campaigns
- Understand the underlying reasons behind user attitudes and beliefs

### Behaviorial research

Behavioral research aims to understand the actions and behaviors of users in relation to a particular product or service. It typically includes studies of how users interact with the product or service, how they navigate through different features or pages, or how they respond to different design elements. Behavioral research might involve using tools like heat maps or click tracking software. This type of research is often used to:
- Inform the design of specific user flows, e.g., onboarding 
- Personalize product experience, e.g., by providing user-specific recommendations
- Identify areas for improvement in a product or service

## UX Design principle: Mix it up!
💡 When conducting research, use a mix of both quantitative and qualitiative research, as well as a mix of attitudinal and behavioral approaches. This enables you to get the clearest and most naunced view of a design problem.
