## Getting your priorities right

Now that you have figured out what you REALLY want, the next step is to determine if what you want is REALISTIC. You need to identify which of your goals are within reach based on their outcomes, your environment and your ability to achieve them. 

Setting unrealistic goals can lead to frustration, disappointment, and a lack of motivation. If you set goals that are too difficult or impossible to achieve, you may become discouraged and give up on them entirely, which can hinder your progress and prevent you from achieving success.

When you set realistic goals, you are more likely to achieve them, which can boost your confidence and motivation. Realistic goals are ones that you can attain with the resources and abilities available to you, given the constraints of your situation. By setting goals that are challenging but achievable, you can experience the satisfaction of making progress towards your objectives and be motivated to continue working towards them.

Therefore, it is important to set goals that are realistic and attainable to ensure that you can achieve them and maintain a positive mindset while working towards them.

In order to determine whether your goals are realistic you should:

- Evaluate your current resources: Assess the resources you have available, such as time, money, and skills, to determine if they are sufficient to achieve your goal.
- Consider your past experiences: Think about similar goals you have set in the past and whether or not you were able to achieve them. This can help you assess your ability to achieve the new goal.
- Research the goal: Gather information about the goal and the steps required to achieve it. This can help you identify any potential obstacles or challenges that may arise.
- Break the goal down into smaller steps: Divide the goal into smaller, more manageable tasks. This can help you assess the feasibility of the goal and determine if it is achievable within a specific time frame.
- Get feedback: Share your goal with others and get feedback from them. This can provide you with different perspectives on the goal and help you identify any potential roadblocks.
- Make adjustments: Based on your evaluation, adjust the goal as needed. You may need to make the goal more specific, adjust the timeline, or break it down into smaller tasks.

By taking these steps, you can determine if your goals are realistic and make any necessary adjustments to ensure that you are setting yourself up for success.
