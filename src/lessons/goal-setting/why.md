## Making your internship experience meaningful

If someone were to walk up to you and ask: ‚ÄúWhy are you planning to go through an internship experience?‚Äù Would you have an answer?

If you answered yes, is your answer more external focused or internal focused? An example of an external reason would be: ‚Äúbecause the Kibo requirements dictate that I have to‚Äù while an internal reason could be: ‚Äúbecause I want to utilize this experience to practice my ability to work well with others in a real work environment.‚Äù

If you answered no, worry not. This lesson will help guide you through the process of establishing your why and setting the right foundations for your industry experience. 

Whether you answered yes or no, the first step in this goal setting process is to determine what your goals REALLY are. What do you REALLY want to achieve?

In this video, Luke asserts that if we take the time to dig deep and listen to what our life experiences so far have taught us we will be able to determine which desires are from within and which ones are influenced by what other people have determined as worthy of desire.

In the document below **(make a copy)**, take time to list down 3-5 instances where you have felt the most fulfilled in your work/school life. What were the drivers of the feeling of fulfillment? How do you want your upcoming internship to feed the feeling of fulfillment and maybe even help you discover new ones? What steps do you intend to take?

This exercise is for your eyes only so be as honest and candid with yourself as possible and ensure that you take some minutes to think about it before jotting down your responses.
