## Making your industry experience meaningful

If someone asked you, _‚ÄúWhy are you planning to go through an industry experience?,‚Äù_ What would you say?

Perhaps your answer would be ‚Äúbecause the Kibo requirements dictate that I have to‚Äù or maybe ‚Äúbecause I want to utilize this experience to practice my ability to work well with others in a real work environment.‚Äù

The next few months of preparing and applying for opportunities will be challenging. To perservere, you need to understand _why_ you are doing this beyond the Kibo requirements. You need a _thick_ desire  to succeed. This lesson will help guide you through the process of establishing your why and setting the right foundations for your industry experience. 

Whether you answered yes or no, the first step in this goal setting process is to determine what your goals REALLY are. What do you REALLY want to achieve?

The video asserts that:
- Each of us is the product of other people's desire
- We must dig deep and examine our life experiences to determine which desires are from within and which ones are influenced by others
