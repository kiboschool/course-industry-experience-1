  🗣 **“If we want to feel an undying passion for our work, if we want to feel we are contributing to something bigger than ourselves, we all need to know our WHY.”** <br>

## Making your industry experience meaningful

If someone asked you, “Why are you planning to go through an industry experience?,” What would you say? Perhaps:

- “Because the Kibo requirements dictate that I have to” or..
- "Because I want to to practice in a real work environment"

The next few months of preparing for industry experience will be challenging. To perservere, you need a reason that you are doing this beyond the Kibo requirements. You need a _thick_ desire  to succeed. This lesson will help guide you through the process of establishing your why and setting the right foundations for your industry experience.

The video asserts that:
- Each of us is the product of other people's desires
- We must examine our life experiences to determine which desires are from within and which ones are influenced by others
