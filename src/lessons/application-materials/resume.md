 As we learn in the video:
 
- The goal of a resume is to stand out to a recruiter. As you craft your resume, consider the perspective of the recruiter, what they are looking for, and how many applicants they are reviewing
- Beyond what's written, the most important thing in a resume is readability
- Your resume should be one page
 
 
## Sections of a resume 

Sections in a resume can vary but a strong resume generally includes a summary of your work experience, education, and skills. For this class, you will create a resume with:

- Contact Information (name, email, city/state, links to github, LinkedIn and a portfolio)
- Summary or tagline
- Skills: programing langauges, technologies, tools
- Experience
- Education
- Additional: Languages, Certifications & Training, Awards


## General Resume tips
- Keep it concise. A resume should be one or two pages long, max.
- Use keywords. When you're applying for jobs online, your resume will likely be scanned by an applicant tracking system (ATS) for keywords that match the job description. To make sure your resume makes it past the ATS, include relevant keywords throughout your resume, such as in your work experience, education, and skills sections.
- Tailor your resume to each job you apply for. You should have a strong general resume, but don't just send out the same resume for every job you apply for. Take the time to tailor your resume to each specific job by highlighting the skills and experience that are most relevant to the position.
- Proofread your resume carefully. Typos and grammatical errors will make you look unprofessional and will hurt your chances of getting the job. _Remember don't knock yourself out. _
- Get feedback. Once you've written your resume, ask a friend, family member, or career counselor to review it and give you feedback. They may be able to catch errors you missed or suggest ways to improve your resume.



## Creating your resume 

The first step to creating your resume is refining the content. At this stage, you should **not** focus on formatting. Formatting is a distraction!

### Complete professional experience

The experience section shows potential employers what you have done in the past and what you are capable of. Like all parts of your resume, it should be clear, concise, and to the point. The goal of the experience section is to **show your valu**e. The title or role you held matters far less than demonstrating the impact you had. When writing about your expeirence, you want to answer the questions:
- What did you do?
- How did you do it?
- What impact did it have?

  ðŸ¤” What if I don't have much professional experience?
 </aside>
 
That's ok! It's expected that you won't have much experience at the beginning of your career. Even if you donâ€™t have an extensive work history, you may have done volunteer, community service, and other projects that show your strengths. Extracurricular activities can also tell recruiters that youâ€™re driven, ambitious, and actively involved in your community. If you have fewer than 3 past work experiences, you may add volunteer or university projects. You may also use those projects if they are particularly relevant. 


#### Tips for writing an effective experience section


- **Start with your most recent experience.** Your most recent experience is the most relevant to your current job search, so it should be listed first.
- **Use strong action verbs.** The video calls these "power verbs." They help convey what you accomplished _and_ are easier to read and more concise . For example, instead of saying "I was responsible for developing marketing campaigns," say "Developed marketing campaigns that increased website traffic by 20%."
- **Show impact and quantify your results.** You need to explain why your work matters. Whenever possible, quantify the results of your work. This will help potential employers see the impact you have made in previous roles. For example, instead of saying "I increased sales," say "I increased sales by 15% in my first year."
