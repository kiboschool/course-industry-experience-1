 As we learn in the video:
 
- The goal of a resume is to stand out to a recruiter. As you craft your resume, consider the perspective of the recruiter, what they are looking for, and how many applicants they are reviewing
- Beyond what's written, the most important thing in a resume is readability
- Your resume should be one page
 
## Sections of a resume 

Sections in a resume can vary but a strong resume generally includes a summary of your work experience, education, and skills. For this class, you will create a resume with:

- Contact Information (name, email, city/state, links to github, LinkedIn and a portfolio)
- Summary or tagline
- Skills: programing langauges, technologies, tools
- Experience
- Education
- Additional: Languages, Certifications & Training, Awards

## General Resume tips

- **Keep it concise**. A student resume should be one page long. In the middle of your career, you might have enough important information to extend to two pages.
- **Use keywords**. When you're applying for jobs online, your resume will likely be scanned by an applicant tracking system (ATS) for keywords that match the job description. To make sure your resume makes it past the ATS, include relevant keywords throughout your resume, such as in your work experience, education, and skills sections.
- **Proofread your resume**. Typos and grammatical errors hurt your chances of getting the job. _Don't knock yourself out._
- **Get feedback**. Ask a friend, family member, or career counselor to review your resume and give you feedback. They might catch errors you missed or suggest improvements.

## Create your resume 

The first step to creating your resume is refining the content. At this stage, you should **not** focus on formatting. 
As you update the information, the formatting will get thrown off -- that's ok. Do not spend time trying to fix the formatting. Formatting is a distraction!

### Download the resume template document 
This resume template is designed to get the basic information you need for you resume. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/12wrJ0G0TDPCXE3AZidtZXPwyeo0NSYBDq38ZLrj0Qps/copy" target="_blank"> Make a copy of this template,</a> then complete the sections in this order:

- Basics and contact information
- Education
- Experience
- Additional
- Summary

### Update name and contact information

Replace the name, phone number, location, linkedin and github address. If you have a separate portfolio website, add that as well. 

### Education experience
Add your 2-3 most recent education experiences. You should not add anything before secondary school. 

### Complete professional experience

The experience section shows potential employers what you have done in the past and what you are capable of. Like all parts of your resume, it should be clear, concise, and to the point. The goal of the experience section is to **show your valu**e. The title or role you held matters far less than demonstrating the impact you had. When writing about your expeirence, you want to answer the questions:

- What did you do?
- How did you do it?
- What impact did it have?

> ü§î What if I don't have much professional experience?

That's ok! It's expected that you won't have much experience at the beginning of your career. Even if you don‚Äôt have an extensive work history, you may have done volunteer, community service, and other projects that show your strengths. Extracurricular activities can also tell recruiters that you‚Äôre driven, ambitious, and actively involved in your community. If you have fewer than 3 past work experiences, you may add volunteer or university projects. You may also use those projects if they are particularly relevant. 


When writing bullet points for your experience

#### Use strong action verbs and explain how you did the work
The video calls these "power verbs." They help convey what you accomplished _and_ are easier to read and more concise.

üõë As an intern at the company, I completed many mission-critical features in the UI 

‚úÖ Built a user login integration with Facebook that increased sign-ups by 20%

üõë Helped the office become more efficient by going paperless

‚úÖ Implemented an electronic ticketing system which sped up operations and reduced ticketing errors


#### Show impact and quantify your results
Explain _why_ your work matters. Whenever possible, quantify the results of your work. 


üõë I increased sales

‚úÖ I increased sales by 15% in my first year

üõë I was responsible for developing marketing campaigns

‚úÖ Developed marketing campaigns that increased website traffic



### Include additional information
- Add a list of relevant technical skills (e.g., programming languages) and tools you are comfortable with
- If you have relevant certifications and trainings, add them 
- Optionally, you may add languages you speak and your interests/hobb

### Add your summary 
Once you have finished adding all of the sections, update the summary. 

### Trim as needed 
Finally, edit your writing to get your resume to fit on one page 

## Submission and Feedback
In this part of the lesson, you will be reviewing your own resume, then providing feedback on a classmate's resume. 

### Self evaluation
- Make a copy of the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1weU7AgOFH9YRlwrebWAMsFOIB2v1GwqtDBaEariksXw/copy" target="_blank"> evaluation document</a>, then evaluate your resume using the rubric. 

### Submit your resume
- Open <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HzJIUcRPkmjnvMNbhQBjXepz6B-tVQqkjZTTzTOl4-I/edit#gid=0" target="_blank">this spreadsheet</a>
- Find your name 
- Add a link to your resume in Column C. Ensure that the document is set so that anyone at kibo school with the link can comment

### Peer evaluation

> üì∫ Watch the video below for instructions on conducting peer evaluations

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0;">
  <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zpHVPenqaDk" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe>
</div>

The final step is to conduct a peer review. This is an opportunity to get #BetterTogether and provide thoughtful and honest feedback to your classmates. Giving useful and constructive feedback is a critical workplace skill, so this will also help _you_ grow as a professional.

To complete the peer evaluation:

- Open <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HzJIUcRPkmjnvMNbhQBjXepz6B-tVQqkjZTTzTOl4-I/edit#gid=0" target="_blank">this spreadsheet</a>
- Look for a row with a **resume link in column C but without a value in Column D** (Peer Reviewer Name)
- Add your first and last name to Column D. You will be conducting a review for this resume
- Open the link in Column C
- Make another copy of the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1weU7AgOFH9YRlwrebWAMsFOIB2v1GwqtDBaEariksXw/copy" target="_blank"> evaluation document</a>, then evaluate your peer's resume
- When you are finished, share the evaluation with the person
  - Click the "Share" button
  - Type the name of the person whose resume you reviewed
  - Share the evaluation with your classmate via email

### Responding to feedback

After receiving feedback on your resume, you should review the feedback and make necessary changes. 

- If you have questions or need clarification, you can drop a comment in the document for the reviewer or reach out to them on Discord 
- Once you have made improvements based on your peer feedback, you may submit your resume for instructor review by following the steps on the [assignment](/lessons/application-materials/assigmnent.md) page.
