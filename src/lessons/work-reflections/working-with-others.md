As the video explains, we often have to work with people we would not otherwise choose to spend time with. Interpersonal conflict is inevitable. In order to move through and learn from interpersonal conflict, you can focus on managing yourself and your reaction. In this lesson, we'll explore three key habits for working effectively with others: 

- Be professional
- Be ethical 
- Build relationships

## Be professional
Stepping into a professional environment may feel overwhelming. However, you can navigate work with confidence. 

**_First impressions matter_**; from the moment you walk through those office doors (or join the first virtual meeting), remember that you are representing both yourself and the organization you're interning for. Dress appropriately for the workplace, ensuring your attire is professional and aligns with the company's dress code. Remember, it's always better to be slightly overdressed than underdressed. Practice good hygiene and grooming habits to present yourself in a polished manner. A neat appearance will not only boost your confidence but also show that you take your role seriously. **Your appeareance matters, even in a virtual workplace.** For video calls, you should be in a quiet place and test your audio and video connection. You should ensure your background is professional and does not distract from your work. 

**_Time management and punctuality_** are key to demonstrating professionalism. Arrive at work and meetings on time, as this shows respect for other people's schedules. If you anticipate being late or unable to attend a meeting, notify the relevant parties in advance. Do what you say you will do, and meet deadlines. Refer to the previous lesson on staying organized.  

**_Collaboration and teamwork_** are essential skills in any professional setting. You will likely work alongside a diverse group of individuals with varying expertise and backgrounds. Embrace the opportunity to collaborate and contribute to team projects. Remember to actively participate in meetings, share your ideas, and listen to the perspectives of others. Respect different viewpoints and be open to constructive feedback.

Lastly, **_maintaining a positive and professional attitude_** is crucial. Be proactive and demonstrate a willingness to learn and take on new challenges. Show enthusiasm for your work and be receptive to feedback and guidance from your mentors. Additionally, maintain a sense of professionalism in all your interactions, even in more casual settings. Avoid gossiping or engaging in negative conversations that can harm team dynamics. Treat everyone with kindness and respect, regardless of their position or role within the organization. 

Professionalism is not just about following rules; it's about **_embodying values that contribute to a harmonious and productive work environment_**. So, embrace this learning experience, be authentic, and let your professionalism shine!

## Be ethical
Ethics serve as the moral compass in any professional setting. They shape how we conduct ourselves and make decisions. You'll encounter numerous situations where ethical judgment will be vital. Remember, acting ethically means **_doing what is right, even when it may be difficult or inconvenient_**. This involves treating colleagues, clients, and stakeholders with respect, honesty, and fairness. It is important to embody ethical principles, such as integrity, confidentiality, and transparency, which form the foundation of professional conduct. 

Understanding the legal landscape in your industry is  crucial to your success. **_Familiarize yourself with the laws and regulations_** relevant to your field, such as intellectual property rights, data privacy, and anti-discrimination laws. If you are uncertain about these, ask your supervisor. Ensure that you avoid conflicts of interest and the potential consequences they can have on your reputation and the organization as a whole.

It is important to recognize that **_ignorance of the law is not a defense_** if legal issues arise. Be mindful of your responsibilities when handling sensitive information. Acting in violation of ethical standards or laws not only damages your professional reputation but can also have severe legal repercussions for both you and the organization. This may include fines, legal penalties, loss of employment, and damage to personal and professional relationships.

By adhering to legal standards, you contribute to a safe and compliant work environment. Making ethical choices and complying with the law is not only the right thing to do but also protects your own future and the welfare of the organization you represent.

## Build relationships

Being an effective colleague is not only about getting work done. As you embark on industry experience, you should prioirtize both **doing good work** and **building strong relationships**.

In this video John English reveals the 4 keys to creating healthy work relationships with an emphasis on communication and establishing psychological safety. The keys are:
1. _Presence; each person has to be present in the interaction._ 

2. _Clarity and understanding; we have to be clear about what we are saying/doing and the end goal._

3. _Respect and appreciation for one another._

Building a strong professional network opens doors to new opportunities, helps you gain valuable insights, and enhances your personal growth. It's all about creating a community of individuals who can support and guide you throughout your career. So, don't be afraid to step out of your comfort zone, introduce yourself to new people, and engage in conversations that go beyond the surface level.

When it comes to networking, **_quality trumps quantity_**. Take the time to understand other people's perspectives, listen actively, and show genuine interest in their work. Networking is a two-way street, so remember to offer your help and support whenever possible. Building trust and rapport takes time, but the connections you make can be invaluable throughout your professional journey.

During your industry experience, aim to network with your peers, supervisors, and colleagues. You can do this by:
 - Participating in company-sponsored activities
 - Reaching out to people you want to get to know, and asking for a coffee chat (in-person or virtual) or an informational interview 

Networking is not just about exchanging business cards; it is **_a continuous process that requires effort and authenticity_**. By approaching it with a genuine desire to connect, learn, and support others, you'll build a strong network that can greatly contribute to your personal and professional growth.

While you should be getting to know your colleagues, remember that you will be evaluated first and foremost on the quality of your work. Cementing your reputation as someone who does high-quality work is critical. Your colleagues will be more open to building relationships, and helping you connect with others in their network if they see you as someone who produces strong work.
