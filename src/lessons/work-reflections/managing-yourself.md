 ## Why Self-Management Matters
 When approaching school or work, we often place a lot of focus on "who's in charge." At school, this might be the instructor or at work, a manager. While it's important to understand what your higher-ups expect of you, your first and most important manager is yourself. ** To succeed at work, you need to become an effective self-manager.

  💡 Self-management means taking responsibility for your actions, emotions, and well-being. It means consciously directing and regulating your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors to achieve goals, maintain balance, and adapt to change.

Self-management requires cultivating various skills and practices, including self-awareness, goal setting, time management, emotional regulation, effective decision-making, adaptability, self-discipline, and self-care. In this lesson, we'll focus on two of those practices: time-management and adaptability.

### The video shares 6 habits of highly organized people:
 
1. Keep it simple: have as few steps as possible in your plan; elaborate sysytems are hard to maintain and most of the time they are not worth the effort.
 
2. Develop routines: turn your import tasks into rutines to save yourself the mental energy of constant planning.
 
3. Have a place for everything and put everything in place: take the time to put items where they belong to make it easier to track and save time trying to locate them.
 
4. Keep a current and detailed to-do list: work backwards by determining your end goal and then decide the steps you will follow to get there.
 
5. Don't be a perfectionist: it's less about perfection and more about action and progress.
 
6. Toss things and purge routinely: continously re-evaluate your tasks and only continue working on the relevant and important tasks.


## Adaptability and Resilience

Change is inevitable, and the ability to embrace it is critical at work. You may be asked to step into an unexpected role, a client might require substantial changes to something you're working on, or a colleague might leave your team. It's normal to feel uneasy during transitions, but by developing the ability to adjust your plans and strategy, you can transform uncertainty into possibility. Embracing change will not only help you thrive personally but also contribute to the success of your organization.

A few things to remember when striving to be adaptable and flexible in the workplace:

#### Navigating Setbacks

When faced with challenges, start by reframing setbacks as temporary roadblocks rather than permanent failures. Take a moment to acknowledge your emotions, but don't dwell on them. Instead, focus on analyzing the situation, identifying lessons learned, and adapting your approach.

#### Cultivating Flexibility

Embrace flexibility and be willing to step outside your comfort zone and explore different ways of doing things. As you encounter unexpected situations, remain calm, and assess the best course of action. Ultimately, flexibility is not about compromising your values or goals but rather finding creative solutions to overcome obstacles.

#### Building a Support Network

No one succeeds alone. Surround yourself with positive and supportive individuals who can offer guidance, encouragement, and constructive feedback. Cultivate relationships with colleagues, mentors, and peers who inspire you to grow and develop.

#### Self-Care and Well-being

Prioritize self-care to maintain a healthy work-life balance. Engage in activities that rejuvenate you, such as exercise, hobbies, and spending time with loved ones. Take breaks when needed and practice mindfulness to stay grounded. Taking care of yourself allows you to better adapt to challenges and bounce back stronger.


As you prepare for your industry experience, reflect on your own past experiences and consider how you can apply these concepts to your daily life. Developing adaptability and resilience is a lifelong journey, and by embracing change, navigating setbacks, cultivating flexibility, building a support network, and prioritizing self-care, you'll be well-equipped to thrive in any situation.
