# Assignment - Behavioral Interviews
-----
For this assignment, you will prepare for and conduct several mock (or practice) interviews with peers and professionals. 

Practice interviews help you practice, receive feedback and improve your skills. When you conduct a practice interview, you’re putting yourself in a situation that mirrors the feeling of an actual job interview. With adequate practice, you will: 
- Better understand yourself and your strengths and weaknesses
- Develop greater comfort and confidence speaking with unfamiliar people

Mock interviews will be conducted by your peers, Kibo staff, and external professionals who are volunteering to help you build your interview skills. Please note:

- At least 1 technical interview and 1 peer interview must be conducted with a classmate
- At least 1 technical interview and 1 peer interview must be conducted with a professional
- The informational interview must be conducted with a professional

### Part 2: Prepare 
Review the lesson pages to prepare. The interview confirmation will include the name of the company you are interviewing for. _Because this is a mock interview, you should not do a lot of company research, but do ensure you know what they company builds._ 

**Expectations**

- Treat your interview like the real thing! This means:
  - Preparing just as you would for an interview with a hiring manager
  - Arriving at least five minutes early 
  - Ensuring you are in a quiet place with good bandwidth where you can appear on video 
  - Bringing copies (links) of your resume and necessary materials
  - Conducting the interview the same way you would an actual professional interview, including demonstrating professionalism 
- Engage in the evaluation
  - Most interviews will be 30 minutes. After that time, the interviewer will have a discussion with you about how it went. This part is critical 
  - Mock interviews will be conducted by technical professionals who are volunteering to help you build your interview skills. They may also be conducted by Kibo staff members
