#### Peer interviews
Use the class Discord channel to find a classmate to conduct the interview with. 

- Set aside one hour (30-minutes to interview, 30-minutes to debrief) to conduct the interview
- After the interview, your peer interviewer should submit the <a href="https://forms.gle/WLLEVSoir9dhRHhR9" target="_blank">interviewer evaluation</a>
- After the interview, you should submit the <a href="https://forms.gle/xzL6N7VKfpbLrn8y8" target="_blank">interviewee self evaluation</a>

#### Informational interviews
For this interview, you will reach out to professionals via LinkedIn or your network to request an informational interview. You should:

- Begin outreach as soon as possible as it may take a few weeks to secure an interview 
- Consider asking your mentor and instructor for introductions to specific people in their network

### Step 2: Prepare 
Review the lesson pages to prepare. The interview confirmation will include the name of the company you are interviewing for. _Because this is an informational interview, you should not do a lot of company research, but do ensure you know what the company builds._ 

**Expectations**

- Treat your interview like the real thing! This means:
  - Preparing just as you would for an interview with a hiring manager
  - Arriving at least five minutes early 
  - Ensuring you are in a quiet place with good bandwidth where you can appear on video 
  - Bringing copies (links) of your resume and necessary materials
  - Conducting the interview the same way you would an actual professional interview, including demonstrating professionalism 
- Engage in the evaluation
  - Most interviews will be 30 minutes. After that time, the interviewer will have a discussion with you about how it went. This part is critical.
  - Mock interviews will be conducted by technical professionals who are volunteering to help you build your interview skills. They may also be conducted by Kibo staff members.

<aside>
❗ Remember that you are representing Kibo in your mock interviews (as you will be on the job market). Be timely, courteous and professional.
