As explained in the video:
- Be confident and show genuine interest in the role
- Be specific and concise
- Communicate your relevant experiences _and_ transferable skills



## Before the Interview
Three key steps to take before the interview are:
1. Research the company and role
2. Plan for logistics
3. Master your emotions 

Let's explore each in more detail. 

### Research
Before an interview, research the company and the role. To do so:

- Read the job description thoroughly and note the skills and attributes required
- Visit the company's website and read their blog and social media pages
- Look for news articles about the company
- Use online resources like Glassdoor, Indeed, and LinkedIn to read about the company

Your aim is to understand, as much as possible, the company's milestones, priorities, mission and values


### Plan the logistics

Arrange all the details of the experience. If you are traveling to a physical location, plan how you will get there and leave ample time for diversions. For a Zoom meeting, decide where you will conduct the interview, which machine you will use, identify and practice with your headphones, determine what you will wear and which, if any, background you will use. Also make sure you have a backup source of internet data.

Planning the logistics, will make your interview process run more smoothly, freeing up more energy to focus on your career goals.

### Master your emotions

Anticipating a job interview can be stressful. The best way to alleviate this stress is to prepare throughly. The more prepared you are for your interview, the less anxious you will feel. Even with thorough preparation, you may still feel anxious and that's ok. To build emotional confidene for your interview:
- Review your preparation notes a few times. 
- Get a good night's sleep. Lack of sleep can make you feel more anxious and stressed. Make sure you get a good night's sleep before your interview so that you can be well-rested and alert.
- Dress for success. Dressing for success can help you feel more confident and prepared for your interview. Choose clothes that make you feel good about yourself and that are appropriate for the company culture.
- Arrive early. Arriving early to your interview will give you time to relax and collect your thoughts. It will also show the interviewer that you are punctual and reliable.
- Breathe deeply. If you start to feel anxious during your interview, take a few deep breaths. This will help to calm your nerves and center yourself.
- Focus on the positive. Try to focus on the positive aspects of the interview and the opportunity. Remind yourself of your strengths and qualifications, and why you would be a good fit for the job.
- Be yourself. The most important thing is to be yourself during your interview. The interviewer wants to get to know the real you, so don't try to be someone you're not


## During the Interview

### Introduce yourself well
The beginning of the interview is critical, and a well-crafted introduction can set a positive tone for the rest of the interview. At the beginning of your interview, you should:
- Greet the interviewer 
- Clearly say your name. This is especially important in the African context! Your interviewers may not be familiar with your name 
  - Share your first name only. While it's common in some cultures to share first and last name, it's often easier to share just your first name.
- Have a strong elevator pitch, and be able to answer the most common introduction questions such as:
  - Tell me about yourself
  - Why do you want to work at our company?

<aside>
  If there is a short version of your name or nickname that you prefer to use, share that with your interviewer. For example, I usually introduce myself as "Ope" instead of "Opeyemi" since the former is a bit easier to say. That said -- go with what youa re comfortable being called, and do not change your name to suit anyone.

### Speak confidently, calmly, and clearly

The video is about general speaking, but also applies to speaking well in interviews.

As the video says:
- **Stop making your statements sound like a question!** Speak with conviction, and drop your tonality
- **Drop the truth bomb!** Speak with convinction and believe in yourself and your message
- **Use the power of the pause!** It's ok to take a break which lets you think about what you'll say next, and allows the audience to think about what you just said 


### Listen
An interview is a conversation, not a monologue! Ensure you are listening carefully to the interviewer. Make eye contact and nod to signal you are following along. Jot down notes and ask clarification questions. 


## After the Interview
### Follow Up
A few hours after or the next day, write a brief follow-up to the interview. The follow up should:

- Thank them for the conversation
- Reiterate your qualification and enthusiasm for the position

The follow up should be brief, no more than a few sentences max. Remember that your interviewers are busy, and be respectful of their time
