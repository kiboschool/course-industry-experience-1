## Acing the Behavioral Interview

### Research the company 
Like all interviews, the first step is to research the company. Take some time to research the company and the position you are interviewing for. This will help you to identify the skills and abilities that are important for the job.

### Gather anecdotes
Think about your past experiences, and create some anecdotes. While each job is unique, there are certain skills and traits that employers will look for. You will want to reflect on your past experiences, and find experiences that demonstrate these skills including: communication, teamwork, conflict management, decision making, and self-improvement.
