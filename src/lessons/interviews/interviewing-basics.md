As explained in the video:
- Be confident and show genuine interest in the role
- Be specific and concise
- Communicate your relevant experiences _and_ transferable skills



## Before the Interview

### Research
Before an interview, research the company. To do so:
- Visit the company's website and read their blog and social media pages.
- Look for news articles about the company.
- Use online resources like Glassdoor, Indeed, LinkedIn, and Vault.

Your aim is to understand, as much as possible, the company's milestones, priorities, mission and values


### Plan the logistics

Arrange all the details of the experience. If you are traveling to a physical location, plan how you will get there and leave ample time for diversions. For a Zoom meeting, decide where you will conduct the interview, which machine you will use, identify and practice with your headphones, determine what you will wear and which, if any, background you will use. Also make sure you have a backup source of internet data. 

Planning the logistics, will make your interview process run more smoothly, freeing up more energy to focus on your career goals.

### Master your emotions

Anticipating a job interview can be stressful. The best way to alleviate this stress is to prepare throughly. The more prepared you are for your interview, the less anxious you will feel. Even with thorough preparation, you may still feel anxious and that's ok. To build emotional confidene for your interview:
- Review your preparation notes a few times. 
- Get a good night's sleep. Lack of sleep can make you feel more anxious and stressed. Make sure you get a good night's sleep before your interview so that you can be well-rested and alert.
- Dress for success. Dressing for success can help you feel more confident and prepared for your interview. Choose clothes that make you feel good about yourself and that are appropriate for the company culture.
- Arrive early. Arriving early to your interview will give you time to relax and collect your thoughts. It will also show the interviewer that you are punctual and reliable.
- Breathe deeply. If you start to feel anxious during your interview, take a few deep breaths. This will help to calm your nerves and center yourself.
- Focus on the positive. Try to focus on the positive aspects of the interview and the opportunity. Remind yourself of your strengths and qualifications, and why you would be a good fit for the job.
- Be yourself. The most important thing is to be yourself during your interview. The interviewer wants to get to know the real you, so don't try to be someone you're not


## During the Interview

### Introduce yourself well

### Speak confidently, calmly, and clearly 


### Listen
An interview is a conversation, not a monologue! Ensure you are listening carefully to the interviewer. Make eye contact and nod to signal you are following along. Jot down notes and ask clarification questions. 


## After the Interview
### Follow Up
A few hours after or the next day, write a brief follow-up to the interview. The follow up should:

- Thank them for the conversation
- Reiterate your qualification and enthusiasm for the position

The follow up should be brief, no more than a few sentences max. Remember that your interviewers are busy, and be respectful of their time
