# Technical Interviews

*Estimated Time: 30 minutes*

---

A technical interview for software engineering is a type of interview where the interviewer asks you questions about your technical skills and knowledge. The interviewer is trying to assess your ability to do the job and your potential for growth.

The interviewer may ask you to write code, solve problems, or design systems. They may also ask you questions about your experience and knowledge. The interviewer may ask you to write code on a whiteboard or computer, discuss your portfolio or previous projects, or completing a coding challenge.

As the video notes and we've said repeatedly, pratice is key! The rest of this lesson walks you through tips for practing. In particular, we will be using the STAR method. The STAR method is a helpful way to structure your answers to behavioral interview questions. STAR stands for:
- Situation: Describe the situation you were in.
- Task: What was your role in the situation?
- Action: What steps did you take to address the situation?
- Result: What was the outcome of your actions?


## Acing the Coding Interview

### Research the company 
Like all interviews, the first step is to research the company. Take some time to research the company and the position you are interviewing for. This will help you to identify the skills and abilities that are important for the job.

   Some companies have engineering blogs where they discuss their technical stack, e.g., <a href="https://paystack.com/engineering" target="_blank">Paystak</a> or <a href="https://engineering.atspotify.com/" target="_blank">Spotify.</a> You may want to search for "Company Name" + "Engineering blog" to see if you can learn more about the company's technology team before your interview.

### Practice 
The best way to prepare for technical interviews is to practice! You will be practing in your Data Structures & Algorithms class, as well as through the code practice channel in Discord. 

## Portfolio and personal experience
As part of your technical interview, you may be asked questions about your past experience and projects you've built. This is where having a strong portfolio comes in handly. Providing your interviewer with a first-hand look at the programs youâ€™ve created (or are currently working on) gives them insight into your skills, passions, and creative visions. Before a technical interview, ensure that your portfolio is handy, and you have prepared a brief (few minute) intro to one or more projects.
