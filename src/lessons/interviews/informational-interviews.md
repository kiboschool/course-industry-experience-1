# Informational Interviews

*Estimated Time: 30 minutes*

---

An informational interview is a conversation with someone who is working in an industry or company that interests you. It is a chance to learn more about the industry, the company, and the person's career path. Informational interviews are **not** job interviews, so there is no pressure to sell yourself or to get a job offer. That said, informational interviews can be a powerful interaction for building your network and finding opportunities.

As the video explains, informational interviews can be helpful to build and strengthen your professional network, and get valuable information. The video describes 5 steps to conducing informational interviews. 


## (1) Identify and reach out to professionals

### Ask people you know
Reach out to friends, family, former classmates, or former colleagues. 

### Ask for introductions
Ask your mentors or professors for introductions to people in their network. When asking for introductions, remember that professionals are busy and most people will not get back to you -- that's ok! 

### Do cold outreach
Use online resources (e.g., LinkedIn, Twitter) to find people to interview.

The video suggests including possible times. Instead of specific times, I recommend you include a link to a booking website (try free version of <a href="https://calendly.com/" target="_blank">Calendly</a>) or leave out times entirely and ask when they are free. So, For example:

## (2) Prepare the questions you're going to ask 
Like all interviews, the first step is research! 
- Research the person you are interviewing
- Research the company 
- Ask specific questions that provide insight, but keep it professional. Some good questions include:
  - What led you to your current role?
  - What has been a favorite project you work on?
  - What's something you wish you could change about your role or job?



## (3) Conduct the interview
- Show up early
- Thank the professional, _briefly_ re-introduce yourself, and what you hope to gain from the interview
- Listen carefully, and take notes
- Stay on topic
- Wrap up, and express gratitude

  ‚è∞ Time is valuable! Professionals are busy, and doing you a favor. So, show up early, and do not go over time allotted for the interview.
