An informational interview is a conversation with someone who is working in an industry or company that interests you. It is a chance to learn more about the industry, the company, and the person's career path. Informational interviews are **not** job interviews, so there is no pressure to sell yourself or to get a job offer. That said, informational interviews can be a powerful interaction for building your network and finding opportunities.

As the video explains, informational interviews can be helpful to build and strengthen your professional network, and get valuable information. The video describes 5 steps to conducing informational interviews. 


## (1) Identify and reach out to professionals

### Ask people you know
Reach out to people you know. One of the best ways to find someone to interview is to reach out to people you already know. This could include friends, family, former classmates, or former colleagues. If you don't know anyone who works in the field you're interested in, you can also try reaching out to people you admire on social media.

### Ask for introductions
Ask your mentors or professors for introductions to people in their network. When asking for introductions, remember that professionals are busy and most people will not get back to you -- that's ok! 

### Do cold outreach
Ask your mentors or professors for introductions to people in their network. When asking for introductions, remember that professionals are busy and most people will not get back to you -- that's ok! 

Use online resources. There are a number of online resources that can help you find people to interview. Some of these resources include:

LinkedIn
Indeed
Glassdoor
AngelList
Quora
Twitter



## (2) Prepare the questions you're going to ask 
Like all interviews, the first step is research! 
- Research the person you are interviewing
- Research the company 
- Ask specific questions that provide insight, but keep it professional. Some good questions include:
  - What led you to your current role?
  - What has been a favorite project you work on?
  - What's something you wish you could change about your role or job?



## (3) Conduct the interview
- Show up early
- Thank the professional, _briefly_ re-introduce yourself, and what you hope to gain from the interview
- Listen carefully, and take notes
- Stay on topic
- Wrap up, and express gratitude
