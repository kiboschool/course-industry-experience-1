# Daily Checkins & Time Tracking

Tracking the time you spend on your industry experience or open-source contribution work each week is not only crucial for self-management but is also a required part of your participation in the program. We will be using Botimum in Slack for you to check in and check out whenever you're working. This method allows us not only to ensure you're developing disciplined work habits and managing your time effectively but also to collect this data as part of your assessment. Regularly logging your hours helps prevent procrastination and makes your workflow transparent to your team members, letting them know when you're available or focusing on tasks. Remember, this practice is about more than just fulfilling a requirement; it's about enhancing your productivity, honing your time management skills, and contributing to a supportive and collaborative team dynamic.
