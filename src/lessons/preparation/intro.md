# Introduction

Welcome to the Industry Experience 1! This term you will learn about the world of Open Source Software (OSS) and become an active contributor. By the end of the term, you should have a solid understanding of how to find, join, and contribute to open source projects, as well as how to develop your open source resume. But first, let's set the stage by discussing the prerequisites, objectives, and expectations for this course.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the world of open source, it's essential to have a basic understanding of programming concepts and some experience working with code. While we will provide examples and guidance, you'll get the most out of the material if you apply your prior technical knowledge.

## Expectations

This week, we will focus on the logistics of getting started with your open source project and team.  In the coming weeks, you will learn about being present as a professional, how to work effectively, and about a wide variety of OSS topics.  It's essential to have realistic expectations about what you can achieve during the term:

1. **Practice is crucial**: Learning about open source is just the beginning; to truly develop your skills and become a proficient contributor, you'll need to practice consistently. Keep in mind that the more you contribute to open source projects, the more you'll learn and grow as a developer.

2. **Patience is key**: Becoming proficient in open source collaboration takes time and effort. Don't be discouraged if you encounter challenges along the way; remember that every contribution, no matter how small, is valuable and helps improve the project.

3. **Engagement with the community**: Open source is more than just code; it's about the people who collaborate and contribute to projects. Engage with the community by asking questions, sharing your knowledge, and supporting others. Building relationships with other contributors will enhance your open source experience and help you grow as a developer.

4. **Continuous learning**: Open source is a rapidly evolving field, with new projects, tools, and technologies emerging all the time. Stay curious and open to learning, and take advantage of resources like documentation, tutorials, and community forums to expand your knowledge and stay up-to-date with the latest developments.

5. **Developing a growth mindset**: Embrace the challenges and opportunities that come with open source collaboration. Adopt a growth mindset, which focuses on learning, improvement, and resilience. By viewing obstacles as opportunities for growth, you'll be better equipped to navigate the complex world of open source and achieve success in your contributions.
