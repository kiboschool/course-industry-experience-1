# What is Open Source?

Open source refers to a type of software whose source code is made available to the public, allowing anyone to view, use, modify, and distribute the code. This is in contrast to proprietary software, where the source code is kept secret and only the compiled program is distributed. The core principle behind open source is the idea of collaboration and the belief that sharing knowledge and resources leads to better, more reliable, and more innovative software.

Open source software is built on the premise that when many people work together, they can create something greater than the sum of its parts. Contributors to open source projects come from diverse backgrounds, and they bring a wide range of skills, experiences, and perspectives to the table. This diversity of thought and expertise leads to more robust, innovative, and reliable software.

software is.

It's valuable to have an idea of what open source software (OS) is, and how it differs 
from closed source or proprietary software, particularly since you'll be spending
time throughout your Industry Experience working on OS software. However, you
should also know that not all OS software is created equally.  There is a myriad 
of open source software licenses, each with their own limitations. Many private companies allow the use of open source software (e.g., libraries), though they are 
selective of how the OS software must be licensed so they will adopt it.  We will spend a bit more time exploring this in another module.
