As we near the end of the preparation phase, the next step is to confirm your industry experience. 

## üôãüèø Key Questions

#### I have applied, but don't have an internship yet. What should I do?
Don't worry. Internships are competitive and difficult to obtain as a first-year student. The time you've spent applying will benefit and prepare you for next year's industry experience. We have partnered with a few organizations to provide you an industry experience opportunity. 

All students will be placed in an industry experience with one of our partners. Completing industry experience is **mandatory** to earn your degree at Kibo. 

#### What if I have another internship?
If you have already secured an industry experience that meets the meets the [criteria](https://industry-experience.vercel.app/lessons/applying/good-opportunities.html) for academic credit, let us know about it by submitting the **[confirmation form](https://forms.gle/rX74x7K8xf64wTo88)**. All internships must be approved in order to obtain academic credit. 

#### What if I'm waiting to hear back from an internship?
You should still submit the [matching form](https://forms.gle/RDk6ZZTd4dEJiGW66). The form has a field for you to indicate that you are still waiting to hear back about an opportunity.

We still need the information so we can match you with an industry experience. If you get another internship later and are no longer able to complete your assigned industry experience, email your course instructors to discuss. 

#### When and where will industry experience take place?

Exact times and dates vary. Please note:
- The majority of students will be working on CodeDay Labs projects which will take place from June 26 through August 18
- You should plan to finish your industry experience by September 15, 2023 which is the last official day of the term. Regular classes will resume on October 9, 2023.

#### When will I receive information about my match? What time should I plan on being available?
You will receive more information on your match via email by the end of next week (June 16, 2023).
