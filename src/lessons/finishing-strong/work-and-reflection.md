# Work and Reflection

You will undertake supervised placement and practice under the guidance of an industry professional. You will submit daily standup updates on your work experience and learnings.

We will export a report of your daily standup updates and provide them to you in a PDF form, which you will upload below.

## Daily Checkins & Time Tracking

Tracking the time you spend on your industry experience or open-source contribution work each week is not only crucial for self-management but is also a required part of your participation in the program. We will be using Botimum in Slack for you to check in and check out whenever you're working. This method allows us not only to ensure you're developing disciplined work habits and managing your time effectively but also to collect this data as part of your assessment. Regularly logging your hours helps prevent procrastination and makes your workflow transparent to your team members, letting them know when you're available or focusing on tasks. Remember, this practice is about more than just fulfilling a requirement; it's about enhancing your productivity, honing your time management skills, and contributing to a supportive and collaborative team dynamic.

## Daily Standups

Standups are a staple in the tech industry, serving as a key component of agile methodologies to ensure team alignment, facilitate quick problem-solving, and foster open communication on a daily basis.

As part of your open-source experience, beginning in the second week, you'll be engaging in daily standups to ensure continuous communication and progress within your project team. Standups will be conducted asynchronously via a dedicated bot in Slack. This lesson outlines expectations for your daily standup participation, provides examples of meaningful updates, and introduces the rubric for evaluating your standup contributions at the end of the term.

## Rubric for Evaluating Standup Updates

- **Good:** Answers all questions with sufficient detail but may lack some specificity in describing tasks or emotions.
- **Fair:** Responses are brief and lack detail in one or more areas, making it difficult to assess progress or well-being.
- **Poor:** Omits one or more questions, offers very little detail, providing no meaningful insight into daily activities or challenges.

### 2. Clarity and Conciseness

- **Excellent:** Updates are clear, concise, and to the point, with no unnecessary information, making it easy for team members to understand tasks and progress.
- **Good:** Generally clear and concise but may include minor unnecessary details or could be more straightforward in explaining tasks.
- **Fair:** Some responses are vague or overly wordy, clouding the understanding of activities or needs.
- **Poor:** Updates are unclear, overly brief, or excessively verbose, hindering comprehension of activities, feelings, or blockers.

### 3. Engagement and Responsiveness
