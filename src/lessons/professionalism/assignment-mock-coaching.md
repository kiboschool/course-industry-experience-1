---

## Instructions

Pick a scenario from the list below and **write a 200-300 word message** OR **record a 2-3 minute video** to the person in the scenario, giving them advice on how they can navigate the challenge that they are facing. Be sure to reference at least 2 things that you learned in this week's lesson in the advice that you give.

## Scenarios

**Scenario 1**
As a first-year computer science intern at a tech startup, Amina found herself in her first team meeting feeling a mix of excitement and nervousness. She glanced around the table, noticing the confident expressions of her senior colleagues discussing the latest project requirements. Despite her enthusiasm, she felt a pang of insecurity creeping in. Would she be able to keep up with the fast-paced discussions? Would her ideas be taken seriously?

**Scenario 2**
When Kwame secured an internship at a software development company, he was thrilled at the opportunity to apply his computer science knowledge in a real-world setting. However, as he delved into his assigned projects, he quickly realized the extent of the technical skill gap between his university studies and the demands of the workplace.

**Scenario 3**
As Fatima juggled her internship at a software development firm with her academic coursework, she found herself grappling with the pressure of looming deadlines. With multiple projects on her plate and a limited amount of time, she often felt overwhelmed and unsure of where to focus her efforts.

**Scenario 4**
When Malik began his internship at a prestigious tech company, he couldn't shake the feeling that he didn't belong. Surrounded by brilliant minds and seasoned professionals, he couldn't help but doubt his own abilities. Thoughts of inadequacy plagued him, causing him to second-guess every line of code he wrote and every idea he proposed.

**Scenario 5**
When Adanna received feedback on her work during her internship at a software development firm, she initially struggled to handle criticism gracefully. Accustomed to the praise and validation she received in university, she found it challenging to accept that her work wasn't always perfect.
