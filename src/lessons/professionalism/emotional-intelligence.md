# Emotional Intelligence in the Workplace

---

In a previous course, ‘Optimizing your Learning,’ you had the chance to learn about two main components of Emotional Intelligence (EQ) related to the ‘Self’ (i.e., Self Awareness and Self Management). Here, you will get to learn about the other two components of EQ related to the ‘Other,’ namely Social Awareness, Empathy, and Relationship Management.  

## Discuss

> 💬 While focusing on the Social part of Emotional Intelligence (EQ), think back on your closest relationships, personal, academic, or professional, and reflect on the questions below:
>
> - Has it been easy for you to understand how others feel?
> - Have you ever been in a position where you had to take the lead in a personal, academic, or professional project? What was the easiest part of the experience? & what was the hardest part of it?
> 
> Submit your reflections in the Padlet below.

### Types of Social Awareness

Different skills contribute to a person developing their social awareness, and by practicing them in your daily interactions, you can further develop your social awareness. Some of the most important skills for Social Awareness development are enlisted below:

- **Emotional Awareness:** is the capacity to recognize one's own emotions and the impact those emotions can have on others.
- **Self Regulation**: is the capacity of a person to maintain composure and refrain from reacting emotionally in a social setting. This is accomplished by being conscious of their escalating emotions and using cognitive techniques to suppress those irrational thoughts.
- **Empathy:** is a person’s ability to comprehend the emotions and state of mind of another. People can better relate to others because they can comprehend the reasoning behind their own actions and emotions in social situations.
- **Active Listening:** is carefully listening to another individual while offering nonverbal clues and affirmations to let them know you are paying attention. The listener may nod in agreement, summarize what the speaker is saying, or offer commentary that is pertinent to the conversation.
- **Kindness:** is the trait of treating others with warmth and affability. This means being generous and considerate to other people.
- **Cooperation** is the ability to collaborate with others to achieve a common objective. Compromise, active listening, and the use of empathic communication techniques may all be part of this.
- **Respect:** is appreciating human worth. It involves valuing someone else and their principles and values.

### Scenarios from the field

Read the scenarios below, and in the subsequent padlet, reflect on:

- What is not going well?
- How could it be avoided?
- Which types of social awareness should these people further develop to avoid the negative outcomes?

**Scenario 1:**
Adamma is a very enthusiastic engineer. He is always at the top of his tasks and delivers his projects to clients on time. As his boss appreciates his work ethic and quality, he starts to assign Adamma big complex projects with short notice and tight deadlines. As a result, Adamma’s enthusiasm, productivity, and work quality start to decline.

**Scenario 2:**
Aisha, a new employee at a tech company, worked very hard on her presentation for the weekly team meeting and sent it to her colleague, Edna, for some quick feedback. Being a new employee, Aisha was very stressed about her first team presentation. However, instead of giving Aisha the requested feedback, Enda responds by saying, ‘It’s just a silly presentation; you are overstressing.’ Aisha’s facial expressions changed to overcast, and she left Edna’s desk quickly.

**Scenario 3:**
Tina was having a bad work day and needed someone to hear her thoughts. She went on to her colleague, Tom, during their lunch break to vent. As she was describing her concerns and explaining why she was feeling what she was feeling, Tom kept checking his phone notifications and randomly flipping the pages of a report he had on the table. Noticing is disinterest, Tina stopped talking and quickly finished her lunch in silence before heading back to her desk.

## Empathy

> 📺 Let’s first watch the video below to get a better understanding of ‘Empathy’ as a skill and how it is different from Sympathy. Both terms are mistakenly used interchangeably, and for us to have a better understanding of the skill of ‘Empathy’ we will review it in comparison with Sympathy.

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1Evwgu369Jw?si=T9RyUaDOwm0YrVyl"  title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>

Empathy is the ability to emotionally understand **how others** feel, see things from **their own perspective,**  and imagine yourself **in their place.** In essence, it means being in the position **of others**  and feeling what **they** are feeling. Empathy, in reality, means when you see a colleague at school or at work struggling with a skill, you show reasonable concern and support them as they grow that specific skill they are struggling with. It also means avoiding quick judgment when a colleague reacts in a way that is not ‘normal’ or ‘appropriate’ during a social encounter. It requires being an active listener, asking the right questions, and approaching situations with objectivity. Although empathy entails feeling with others, it is also important to practice how not to get so emotionally invested.

### Empathic Collaboration

To bring innovative and creative solutions to group work, it is important that everyone in the team is respected, included, and has a say in the decision-making. And that is only possible when a safe space is created for everyone to do so. Bringing together different perspectives into a group task or a project requires Empathy as a driving vehicle for those conversations and negotiations for it to be effective. There are four suggested steps by which a team can strengthen their Empathy as a skill during collaborative work:

**1 - Create a welcoming space for diverse perspectives**: As a team player or leader, always ensure that everyone gets a chance to talk, share their opinion, and explain their concerns as the team works on a task or project.

**2 - Create opportunities to build trust**: When diverse team members find a safe space to share their ideas and thoughts, their opinions are not disregarded, and they don’t feel judged for sharing their perspectives. Trust is the outcome of such practices.

**3 - Turn tensions and frictions into positive learning experiences**: Tensions naturally arise when different opinions are suggested by different members. This, however, should not be approached badly. Instead, team members should approach the situation with open-mindedness, assume the best in others, and that their intention is to contribute to the task or project at hand.

**4 - Support others to succeed**: The growth of one person does not impact that of other team members, and this should be a guiding rule in every team. Highlighting areas of strength of each member, praising their efforts and work, and calling on them as experts in a given task all build strong teams.

By following the suggested steps above, each team member and leader will be able to develop very strong team dynamics, which increases the chances for empathic collaboration among the team.

> ❓ Now that you have a general understanding of the ‘5 Chairs’, take time to reflect on your reaction to unpleasant social situations or when someone pushes your ‘red button. Use the Padlet space below to respond to this scenario and what would be your habitual reaction to it.
>
>**Scenario:**

After you shared it with them, they contacted the manager of your company and asked for a different developer for their next project without explaining why.
>
>1. What would be your instant reaction to the client's behavior?
>2. Will your instant reaction have a negative impact on your relationship as a service provider and former customer?
>3. How would you avoid sitting in the ‘Attack’ or ‘Self-doubt’ chairs in this situation?
>4. How do you see the learning from this experience being applied to your academic and professional careers? 
>
>After sharing your response, please comment on two of your classmates’ responses and how you relate or would use a different way to address the situation.
