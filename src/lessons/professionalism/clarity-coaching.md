## Why Self-Management Matters

When approaching school or work, we often place a lot of focus on "who's in charge." At school, this might be the instructor or, at work, a manager. While it's important to understand what your supervisors expect of you, your first and most important manager is yourself. **To succeed at work, you need to become an effective self-manager.**

<aside>
💡 Self-management means taking responsibility for your actions, emotions, and well-being. It means consciously directing and regulating your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors to achieve goals, maintain balance, and adapt to change.

</aside>

Self-management requires cultivating various skills and practices, including self-awareness, goal setting, task management, emotional regulation, effective decision-making, adaptability, self-discipline, and self-care. In this lesson, we'll focus on a few of those practices that will help you excel in the workplace.

## Task Management

> 📺 Watch this video to understand how to be more organized and productive at work (5:34)

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/88MjoZalHpM" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>

The video shares six habits of highly organized people:

1. **Keep it simple**: have a few steps in your plan; elaborate systems are hard to maintain, and most of the time, they are not worth the effort.
2. **Develop routines**: turn your important tasks into routines to save yourself the mental energy of constant planning.
3. **Have a place for everything and put everything in place**: take the time to put items where they belong to make it easier to track and save time trying to locate them.
4. **Keep a current and detailed to-do list**: work backward by determining your end goal and then decide the steps you will follow to get there.
5. **Don't be a perfectionist**: it's less about perfection and more about action and progress.
6. **Toss things and purge routinely**: continuously re-evaluate your tasks and only continue working on the relevant and important tasks.

### Understanding Your Tasks

In school, you are evaluated through assessments that (hopefully) have clear instructions and maybe even a rubric that tells you exactly what you need to show to get points. At work, you will frequently be faced with tasks that are unclear and complex, and your manager probably won't be great at articulating their expectations...until you fail to meet them. This may seem unfair. How can someone evaluate your performance against expectations that they didn't share with you?! But this is the reality of the workplace. To counteract this, it is very important that you learn how to ensure that you have a complete understanding of the tasks that are assigned to you, as well as an understanding of the expectations (to whatever degree this is possible).

Therefore, when you don't understand an assigned task at work (or you have just been assigned a task and you are thinking about how to start), it's important to take proactive steps to clarify your understanding and seek the necessary support. Here's what you can do:

**Review the task instructions**: Start by carefully reviewing any instructions or documentation related to the task. Pay attention to specific requirements, deadlines, and expectations outlined in the task description. If you are lucky, there will be detailed instructions. If you are unlucky, you might just have a message from your manager to go on or a discussion from a meeting with some action items. 

**Break down the task**: Break the task down into smaller, manageable steps to identify any areas where you're unclear. This can help you pinpoint specific aspects of the task that you need clarification on. 

**Ask for clarification**: Before you start working, don't hesitate to reach out to your manager, supervisor, or colleagues for clarification if you're unsure about any aspect of the task. Approach them respectfully and explain the areas where you need clarification or additional guidance.  Doing an amazing job on the wrong task is the same as doing a bad job on the correct task.

**Seek examples or demonstrations**: Sometimes, seeing examples or demonstrations of similar tasks can help clarify your understanding. Ask if there are any examples, templates, or previous projects you can refer to for guidance. This will also help you understand expectations more clearly while giving you something to benchmark the quality of your work.

**Take notes**: As you receive clarification or guidance, take notes to ensure you understand the task thoroughly. This can help prevent misunderstandings and serve as a reference as you work on the task.

**Provide updates on your progress**: Once you have a clearer understanding of the task, provide regular, concise updates on your progress to your manager or supervisor. This allows them to monitor your progress, provide feedback, and address any issues or concerns along the way. You should provide updates on both what is going well and what is not going well. You want to ensure that they always have an accurate picture of the status of the work. Updates can be in the form of active updates, where you send a summary of progress to them. Or passive updates, where you create a dashboard or other system that your manager can take a look at whenever they want to check on the progress of your work.

### Getting Help

Part of understanding your tasks requires you to ask for help, so it is worth spending some time discussing how to ask for help more broadly. Getting help at work requires a balance of assertiveness, humility, and respect for your colleagues' time and expertise. Here's a step-by-step approach:

**Assess the Situation**: Take a moment to evaluate the situation and determine the specific help or support you need. Clarify your own understanding of the problem or task before seeking assistance.

**Identify the Right Person**: Consider who the best person is to help you with your specific issue. It could be your manager, a colleague with relevant expertise, a mentor, or someone from another department who has the necessary knowledge or resources.

**Choose the Right Time**: Respect your colleagues' time by choosing an appropriate time to approach them for help. Avoid interrupting them during busy periods or when they're clearly occupied with other tasks.

**Be Clear and Specific**: When requesting help, be clear and specific about what you need assistance with. Provide context, background information, and any relevant details to help the person understand the problem or task.

**Ask Open-Ended Questions**: Instead of simply asking for the solution, consider asking open-ended questions that encourage dialogue and collaboration. This can help you gain a deeper understanding of the issue and facilitate a more productive exchange of ideas.

**Listen and Learn**: Be receptive to the advice, feedback, or guidance you receive from your colleague. Listen actively, ask follow-up questions, and take notes if necessary. Learning from others' expertise is an invaluable opportunity for professional growth.

**Express Gratitude**: Remember to express gratitude to your colleague for their help and support. A simple "thank you" goes a long way in acknowledging their time and expertise.

**Offer Assistance in Return**: If appropriate, offer to return the favor by helping your colleague with something in the future. Building a culture of mutual support and collaboration fosters a positive work environment and strengthens professional relationships.

## Adaptability and Resilience

Change is inevitable, and the ability to embrace it is critical at work. You may be asked to step into an unexpected role, a client might require substantial changes to something you're working on, or a colleague might leave your team. It's normal to feel uneasy during transitions, but by developing the ability to adjust your plans and strategy, you can transform uncertainty into possibility. Embracing change will not only help you thrive personally but also contribute to the success of your organization.

Here are a few things to remember when striving to be adaptable and flexible in the workplace:

**Reframe Setbacks**: When faced with challenges, start by reframing setbacks as temporary roadblocks rather than permanent failures. Take a moment to acknowledge your emotions, but don't dwell on them. Instead, focus on analyzing the situation, identifying lessons learned, and adapting your approach.

**Cultivate Flexibility**: Embrace flexibility and be willing to step outside your comfort zone and explore different ways of doing things. As you encounter unexpected situations, remain calm, and assess the best course of action. Ultimately, flexibility is not about compromising your values or goals but rather finding creative solutions to overcome obstacles.

**Build a Support Network**: No one succeeds alone. Surround yourself with positive and supportive individuals who can offer guidance, encouragement, and constructive feedback. Cultivate relationships with colleagues, mentors, and peers who inspire you to grow and develop.

**Practice Self Care**: Engage in activities that rejuvenate you, such as exercise, hobbies, and spending time with loved ones. Take breaks when needed and practice mindfulness to stay grounded. Taking care of yourself allows you to better adapt to challenges and bounce back stronger.

As you prepare for your industry experience, reflect on your own past experiences and consider how you can apply these concepts to your daily life. Developing adaptability and resilience is a lifelong journey, and by embracing change, navigating setbacks, cultivating flexibility, building a support network, and prioritizing self-care, you'll be well-equipped to thrive in any situation.

## Managing Up

While it is important to be an effective self-manager, there is a similar technique called **managing up**, which can indirectly support self-management by providing clarity on expectations, feedback, resources, and opportunities for professional growth. It can enhance your ability to navigate the organizational hierarchy and advocate for your own needs, ultimately contributing to your effectiveness in managing yourself.

<aside>

**What is managing up?**

Managing up refers to the practice of effectively working with and influencing your superiors or managers in order to achieve better outcomes for yourself, your team, and the organization as a whole. It involves understanding your manager's preferences, priorities, and communication style and then adapting your own approach to better align with them. Managing up can include things like effectively communicating progress, anticipating needs, providing solutions, and seeking feedback to ensure you're meeting expectations. It's essentially about building a strong working relationship with your superiors to enhance collaboration and productivity.
</aside>

There are a couple of ways in which managing up supports self-management:

**Clear Expectations**: By effectively managing up, you can gain clarity on your manager's expectations, priorities, and preferences. This understanding allows you to align your own goals and tasks accordingly, helping you manage yourself more effectively.

**Feedback and Guidance**: When you have a good relationship with your manager, you're more likely to receive constructive feedback and guidance. This input can help you improve your performance and adjust your self-management strategies as needed.

**Resource Allocation:** Through managing up, you can advocate for the resources and support you need to effectively manage yourself. Whether it's additional training, tools, or time allocation, having a positive relationship with your manager can make it easier to negotiate for what you require to succeed.

**Professional Development**: Managing up can provide opportunities for professional development, such as mentorship or exposure to new projects and responsibilities. These experiences can enhance your skills and competencies, ultimately supporting your ability to manage yourself more effectively.

**Recognition and Rewards**: While it is often true that actions speak louder than words, in a busy workplace, if you are poor at managing up, it is easy for your accomplishments to go unnoticed. When you manage up effectively, you're more likely to receive recognition for your contributions and achievements. This acknowledgment can boost your confidence and motivation, reinforcing positive self-management behaviors.


> 📺 Watch this video to learn about managing up.

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/d1pqH5o_M1g?si=v_WGxDq6DV_rCFmf" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>

Here are five tips for managing up effectively:

**Tip 1 - Understand your manager's preferences and communication style**: Take the time to observe how your manager likes to communicate, their preferred communication channels, and their expectations for updates and feedback. Adjust your own communication style to align with theirs, whether it's providing concise email updates, scheduling regular check-ins, or seeking face-to-face meetings.

**Tip 2 - Anticipate needs and provide solutions**: Proactively anticipate your manager's needs and provide solutions before they're asked for. This can involve staying ahead of deadlines, identifying potential challenges, and offering suggestions or alternatives to address them. By demonstrating initiative and problem-solving skills, you can build trust and credibility with your manager.

**Tip 3 - Seek feedback and act on it**: Actively seek feedback from your manager on your performance, projects, and areas for improvement. Listen attentively to their feedback and take constructive criticism in stride. Use the feedback to adjust your approach, refine your skills, and demonstrate your commitment to continuous improvement.

**Tip 4 - Manage expectations effectively**: Be transparent with your manager about your workload, priorities, and capacity. Set realistic expectations for what you can accomplish and communicate any challenges or constraints you may be facing. By managing expectations effectively, you can avoid misunderstandings and ensure alignment on goals and timelines.

**Tip 5 - Build a positive working relationship**: Invest in building a positive and mutually respectful relationship with your manager. Take the time to get to know them as a person, show appreciation for their guidance and support, and demonstrate your commitment to the team's success. Building a strong rapport with your manager can make it easier to navigate challenges, collaborate effectively, and advocate for your needs.

**Following these tips will help you become a "low-maintenance superstar," as mentioned in the video!**

## Advise Rachel

> ❓ Read the following scenario about the experience of a 2nd year Kibo student during their internship role. Then, based on what you now know about self-management and managing up, **give Rachel some advice on what she could do to improve her situation and turn her internship experience around.**
>
> When Rachel joined GlobeTech for a summer software engineering internship 3-weeks ago, she was eager to learn and contribute to real-world projects. However, in her first few weeks, she dove into her assigned tasks without seeking clarification or guidance from her manager, Mark. She was hesitant to ask questions for fear of appearing incompetent, so she worked in isolation, often missing important details and deadlines. As a result, Rachel's work didn't meet the expected quality standards, and Mark started to notice issues with her performance.
>
> Feeling bad about her performance, Rachel started to avoid interacting with Mark, hoping to figure things out on her own. When Mark finally reached out to check on Rachel's progress, he was surprised by the lack of clarity and organization in her work. He tried to provide constructive feedback and guidance, but Rachel seemed defensive and unwilling to accept help.
>
> Now, a third of the way through her internship and despite being an A student with strong technical skills, Rachel is still struggling to prioritize tasks, communicate effectively, and collaborate with her manager and team members.
