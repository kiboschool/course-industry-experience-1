# Open Source Licensing

For software to be considered open source, it must be released under a license that grants users the right to access, modify, and distribute the source code. There are numerous open source licenses available, each with its own set of terms and conditions. Some popular open source licenses include the MIT License, the GNU General Public License (GPL), and the Apache License.

These licenses are crucial because they ensure that the software remains open and accessible to everyone. By granting users the right to view, modify, and distribute the code, open source licenses promote a culture of collaboration, innovation, and shared knowledge.

Open source licenses range from permissive to copyleft. **Permissive licenses**, like MIT, Apache, and BSD, are minimal in restrictions, allowing for broad freedom in using and incorporating software into both open source and proprietary projects. **Copyleft licenses**, such as GPL, AGPL, and LGPL, require that modifications and derived works also be distributed under the same license, ensuring the software remains free and open.

Watch this short interview with Ibrahim Haddad (VP, Strategic Programs, The Linux Foundation).  He shares his knowledge the ubiquity of open source softare, the use of automated tools to identify and track licensed components, and the the impact that generative AI will have on open source.

A valuable skill in software development is understanding license compatibility, particularly when combining software under different licenses or integrating open source components into proprietary projects. Compatibility issues can limit how software is combined or modified, so it's important to ensure compliance to maintain legal and ethical standards.  Incorporating open source software into proprietary projects comes with obligations. Depending on the license, developers may need to release source code changes or respect certain distribution conditions. Understanding these obligations is crucial to using open source software ethically and legally in a commercial context. In industry, corporations will often provide guidance to employees about what is and is not allowable use of open source software. It is crucial that you familiarize yourself with and abide by these rules, as improper use of open source software could cause several reputational damage to the company and, in the worst case, cost the company millions of dollars in legal fees or fines.
