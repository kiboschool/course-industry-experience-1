## Umbrella Applications

Some organizations offer 'umbrella' internship programs, where you can apply through the organization, and they can help place you at an internship at one of several companies under their umbrella. These programs sometimes offer additional support and community.

## MLH Fellowship

Here are some application tips from MLH:

> - Most projects look for JavaScript or Python skills (although there are some focused on Java too). We do most of our technical screening and matching through GitHub profiles, so make sure there's good projects in the appropriate languages on there. Having someone with "just" JavaScript experience is fine, but you do want a few in-depth projects visible.
> - I personally think that having a medium/dev.to blog is a good idea too, as you can demonstrate interest areas, technical writing, approach to solving problems / team working on those too.
> - I'd also recommend checking out one of our Info Sessions (latest on is on Youtube: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWxnQwvbDzk&ab_channel=MajorLeagueHacking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWxnQwvbDzk&ab_channel=MajorLeagueHacking) there's lots of info for potential applicants in there too.
