Here are some application tips from MLH:

> - Most projects look for JavaScript or Python skills (although there are some focused on Java too). We do most of our technical screening and matching through GitHub profiles, so make sure there's good projects in the appropriate languages on there. Having someone with "just" JavaScript experience is fine, but you do want a few in-depth projects visible.
> - I personally think that having a medium/dev.to blog is a good idea too, as you can demonstrate interest areas, technical writing, approach to solving problems / team working on those too.
> - I'd also recommend checking out one of our Info Sessions (latest on is on Youtube: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWxnQwvbDzk&ab_channel=MajorLeagueHacking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWxnQwvbDzk&ab_channel=MajorLeagueHacking) there's lots of info for potential applicants in there too.
