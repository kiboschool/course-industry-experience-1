# Identifying Good Opportunities

There are millions of job listings. Most of them aren't a match. The role isn't a fit for you, or you aren't a fit for the role.

A lot of the work in applying to roles is in filtering out bad opportunities, so you only spend your time applying to good opportunities.

## What's a good opportunity?

> Don't waste time applying to bad opportunities.
>
> - _If you would not take the internship if it was offered to you, don't apply._
> - _If you are not qualified for the internship, don't apply._

A good industry experience opportunity means:

1. **You are interested**

  The company and the position are exciting to you.

2. **You are qualified**

  Your skills make you a good fit. 

  You have most of the skills listed in the job description, and are confident that you can learn the others.

3. **The logistics will work**

  The role is near your location, or remote.

  - for opportunties in your city: check that you can manage the commute
  - for remote opportunities: 
    - check that your time zone will work, and you can be online when required
    - check that the company will be able to employ you (_many opportunities require specific citizenship or work authorization_)

  You can commit to the role

  - You've read the associated tasks and responsibilities, and expect to succeed
  - You know the number of hours expected, and can commit to them

  _If you plan to continue with another full-time role, do not apply for a full-time internship!_

### What opportunities qualify?

> **What counts for Industry Experience credit at Kibo?**
>
> Internships and roles can have tons of different names: "Junior Developer" or "Quality Assurance Intern" might be roles that qualify, even though they aren't called "software developer intern". "IT Intern" might qualify or not, depending on the organization and the particular duties of the role.
>
> So, what qualifies a position for credit at Kibo?
>
> - 225+ hours of work
>   - The work may be spread out over any number of weeks (e.g., 30 hours for 8 weeks or 40 hours for 6 weeks). Your industry experience may be longer than the required minimum of 225 hours. You should aim to finish by **September 15, 2023** which is the last offical date of the term. If your experience will continue (e.g., you will keep working part-time), that is fine. But you must submit the evaluations and report for academic credit by September 15 in order to receive credit.
> - Uses the skills you've learned in your coursework
> - There is a mentor or supervisor who will give you feedback and evaluation
>
> So long as those three qualifications are met, then the role can qualify for your industry experience.
>
> If you aren't sure if a particular position qualifies, feel free to ask in the Discord #help-ie channel or message the course instructors.
