# Applying for Opportunities

Now that you've identified positions to apply to, it's time to submit an application.

## Application steps

1. Find key information about the company and role
2. Follow the application instructions
3. Tailor your application to the role
4. Double checking your application materials
5. Hit send
6. Track your application

### Key information

Once you have identified a company and role to apply to, you need to know some key details in order to make your application successful.

You should try to find this information online, by checking the company's website and LinkedIn page.

**Company Details**

- What does the company do?
- What size is the company?

**Role Details**

- What are responsibilities of the role?
- What skills are required? What keywords does the job description use?
- Who will the role work with? Is there a mentor or supervisor?

**Application Process details**

- What is the application process for the role? 
- What materials do you need to submit?
- If there is a deadline, what is it? 

You should take notes with your answers to these questions (and anything else you observe about the company and position). When you apply, and later when you interview, you can customize your approach based on what you know about the company.

### Tailoring your application

Most importantly, you should *follow the application instructions*. Include all the materials that are required, and respond to all the questions the application asks. Many candidates filter themselves out by not completing the application as instructed.

Companies are looking for different things. If you tailor your application to the organization and role you are applying for, you stand a better chance of getting the position.

The goal of customizing your resume for the role is to _pass initial filters_. Often, these are keyword checks based on your resume (or other document you upload). Where possible, you should **use the same language that the job description uses** to describe your skills.

Based on the information you found about the company and position, create a version of your resume to fit the position.

## Double checking your application materials

Typos, grammar mistakes, and missing documents can all be huge weaknesses in job applications.

You should take care to get someone else to double-check the materials you plan to submit, to proofread and make sure you didn't miss something.

You can ask a classmate or someone in your squad, or ask for help from staff in the Discord channel. You can also use an online spellchecker, or ask a friend or family member to review.

## Submit your application

Once you have all the pieces, submit your application! The sooner you submit your application, the better chance you have of getting the position.

## Tracking your applications

You should keep track of the status of your applications. This helps you know what you've done, and it helps to be able to look back and see what was effective in your search after the fact.

Make a copy of this [job application tracker (Sheets)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UyblPl26CxdMDx8M8SxoEP-lcgHRGfTXvdGacnkIHMw/copy) and fill it in for each of the roles you apply to. You'll need to submit the tracker for your assignment.

## FAQ

### What should I do if a company I like does not list an internship role?

You can still reach out to someone at the company to see if they are accepting interns. See the next page on [Cold Outreach](/lessons/applying/cold-outreach.md) for more about how to apply when a company does not have a listed position.

### How much to customize each application?

You should spend at least 15 minutes customizing your application to the position. It may mean only changing the keywords in your personal introduction, or it could mean changing the way you describe some of your skills and experience.

For example, if your resume is focused on your software skills, and you are applying for a data science internship, you might:
- move a data-oriented project to the top of your list of projects
- update your skills to focus on the skills relevant to the position, like moving SQL and Python forward, and JavaScript back
- change the wording of your introduction to focus on analytical skills, curiousity, and finding answers (instead of, for instance, on building new things)

You usually won't (or can't) update your portfolio for each position. However, you might find as you apply that you want to update your LinkedIn skills or description, or add things to your portfolio that better represent you.

### What should I expect from a company?

Some companies will not respond to your application. If you have waited more than one week, sending one follow-up by email is appropriate.

Some will have a long process, and will have several rounds of screening and interviews. Others will have a short process, or just admit candidates based on the initial application.

If the process is not described on their website or job description, and they do not tell you what to expect, you can ask by email if they give a positive response to your application.

### Should you apply to multiple roles at the same company?

At large companies, different roles may have different application processes, and you can increase your chances of getting a position if you apply for more than one.

However, it is a negative signal if you apply for roles that are very different from one another, or if you apply for roles that you are not a fit for. If you apply for both an internship and a Senior Software Engineer position at the same company, it may make you look unserious or ignorant, and weaken your chances of getting an internship.
