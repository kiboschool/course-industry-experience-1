# Cold Outreach

"Cold" outreach is when you reach out to someone you don't know, and don't have a referral to connect with.

It's not always successful, since people are busy and might ignore you, but it can also work!

## Warm outreach: Referrals

As mentioned in the lesson on [finding opportunities](lessons/applying/finding-opportunities.html#asking-your-network), you should ask your network for referrals if there is an organization you have a connection to. Introductions are more likely than cold outreach to lead to a meeting.

You might have seen that LinkedIn displays "2nd degree" connections, and shows you who you know in common with someone else. You can ask for that person to connect you:

> Hi [name], I am currently looking for an internship  and I am curious to learn more about [company]. I saw that you are connected with [connection], who works there. Would you mind introducing me? Thank you!

## Cold Outreach

If you don't have a warm referral, you can still reach out to someone.

**When to cold email?**

If there is no job listed, and you don't have a warm referral. 

You can also do cold outreach if you want to try to set up an [informational interview](/lessons/interviews/informational-interviews.md).

**Who to cold email?**

You should try to find the contact information for someone who is close to the program or position you are applying for. At a startup, that might be the CTO or CEO. At a mid-size company, it might be an engineer, engineering manager, or someone from the HR or people team. At a large company, there is likely someone in charge of internships, or in charge of specific internship programs.

For an informational interview, you can reach out to anyone at a company. It's usually more helpful the closer that person is to the position you are applying for (e.g. it's often more helpful to speak to someone on the engineering team than on the sales or marketing team, though either could be useful).

**What to say?**

Cold emails should be brief, polite, clear, and direct. You should have a clear _ask_, and you should offer value.

Here's an example:

> From: rob.student@kibo.school
> To: ope.hiringmanager@example.com
> Subject: Informational Interview with Kibo Student
>
> Hi Ope,
> 
> I'm Rob, a CS student at Kibo. 
> 
> I came across your profile on LinkedIn when looking at companies for a potential internship.
>
> I'm impressed by your team's product, and would love to hear more about how your engineering team works.
>
> Would you be open to a 20-minute conversation in the next few weeks? If so, please suggest a few times that work for you. If it's easier for you, <a href="http://www.example.com/" target="_blank">here</a> is my availability.
>
> Thanks,
>
> Rob

**Getting Help**

Sending cold emails can be intimidating! If you are worried about what to say, or just want another set of eyes to check your language, share your draft in the Discord help channel, or send a copy to industry-experience@kibo.school for feedback.

**Should you send follow-up?**

If someone does not respond to your cold email, they might not be interested in talking with you.

Still, sending one follow-up message after 3-7 days can be effective. You should send it in the same thread as your initial message.

> Hi Ope,
>
> I'd still love to hear more about your team. Do you have time for a quick (20 min) call this week?
>
> Thanks,
> Rob

## Other Platforms

Email is universal, and if you can find an email address, that's usually the best platform for cold outreach. However, other platforms can also be effective.

If someone is open to messages on LinkedIn, you can try sending a direct message there. It is similar to the email message above.

Twitter (or other social media) can also be effective, especially if you have mutual connections. Social platforms tend to be informal, so you usually should leave out the greeting and sign-off.
