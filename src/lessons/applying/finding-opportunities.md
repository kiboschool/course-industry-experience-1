# Finding Opportunities

How do you actually find companies with internships to apply to?

There are a few ways to search:

- Find a role at a company you've already identified
- Get a referral or pointer from your network
- Search on job platforms

## Finding jobs at a particular company

In your goal-setting for this course, you identified at least 10 companies that you were interested in working for. There might be other companies you know of that might be a good fit. (Try to make a list, if you haven't already!)

To find out if they have open opportunities, you should:

- look on their website (check if there is a 'jobs' or 'careers' link, or a dedicated page for internships)
- search on Google for "[company name] internships" or "[company name] jobs"
- search on LinkedIn or the job boards below for the company, or "[company name] internship"

If you find an opportunity this way, check if it is a good fit. If it is, move on to the next step: _applying_.

## Asking your network

Many jobs and placements come through referrals. Even early in your career, you might have a contact who can connect you to an opportunity that would be a good fit.

You should:
- let your network know that you are looking for an internship
- message specific people in your network who could refer you

A good message is polite, direct, individualized, and to the point. Here's an example:

> Hi -- it was great to meet you at the event last week. I am currently looking for a software internship for this July, and I'm wondering if there are specific companies that you'd recommend I apply to. I am a strong python backend developer, and I'm also curious about data science.

(You should tailor your message to the relationship and your own interests.)

## Job databases and platforms

There are tons of job and internship search platforms. The key is to find a site that has lots of opportunities relevant to you.

The top site for job searching in general is [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/jobs). Not all jobs will be posted there, but it is often the first place companies will post their jobs. Be sure that you have your profile set up!

Other job and internship search sites sometimes have roles that LinkedIn does not. 

Google's search results for 'Software Internship [Location]' (e.g. [Lagos](https://www.google.com/search?q=software+engineer+internship+lagos&ei=2eJNZK_WM82B0PEP_M-aiAs&uact=5&oq=software+engineer+internship+nigeria&gs_lcp=Cgxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAQAzIICCEQoAEQwwQyCAghEKABEMMEMggIIRCgARDDBDoKCAAQRxDWBBCwAzoHCAAQigUQQzoNCC4QigUQsQMQ1AIQQzoICAAQigUQkQI6DQgAEIoFELEDEIMBEEM6CggAEIoFELEDEEM6BggAEAcQHjoOCAAQigUQsQMQgwEQkQI6CggAEA0QgAQQsQM6DQgAEA0QgAQQsQMQsQM6BwgAEA0QgAQ6CAgAEAUQBxAeOggIABAIEAcQHjoICAAQBRAeEA06CAgAEAgQHhANOgoIIRCgARDDBBAKSgQIQRgAUK0DWO0tYOYvaAFwAXgBgAF6iAH9FJIBBDI2LjSYAQCgAQHIAQjAAQE&sclient=gws-wiz-serp&ibp=htl;jobs&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi334TI19D-AhXBFzQIHej7CWQQudcGKAF6BAgMECo#fpstate=tldetail&htivrt=jobs&htidocid=lrU9oZasVSwAAAAAAAAAAA%3D%3D), [Nairobi](https://www.google.com/search?q=software+engineer+internship+nairobi&ei=2eJNZK_WM82B0PEP_M-aiAs&uact=5&oq=software+engineer+internship+nigeria&gs_lcp=Cgxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAQAzIICCEQoAEQwwQyCAghEKABEMMEMggIIRCgARDDBDoKCAAQRxDWBBCwAzoHCAAQigUQQzoNCC4QigUQsQMQ1AIQQzoICAAQigUQkQI6DQgAEIoFELEDEIMBEEM6CggAEIoFELEDEEM6BggAEAcQHjoOCAAQigUQsQMQgwEQkQI6CggAEA0QgAQQsQM6DQgAEA0QgAQQsQMQsQM6BwgAEA0QgAQ6CAgAEAUQBxAeOggIABAIEAcQHjoICAAQBRAeEA06CAgAEAgQHhANOgoIIRCgARDDBBAKSgQIQRgAUK0DWO0tYOYvaAFwAXgBgAF6iAH9FJIBBDI2LjSYAQCgAQHIAQjAAQE&sclient=gws-wiz-serp&ibp=htl;jobs&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi334TI19D-AhXBFzQIHej7CWQQudcGKAF6BAgMECo#fpstate=tldetail&htivrt=jobs&htidocid=1RJf_hBBq0QAAAAAAAAAAA%3D%3D), [Accra](https://www.google.com/search?q=software+engineer+internship+accra&ei=2eJNZK_WM82B0PEP_M-aiAs&uact=5&oq=software+engineer+internship+nigeria&gs_lcp=Cgxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAQAzIICCEQoAEQwwQyCAghEKABEMMEMggIIRCgARDDBDoKCAAQRxDWBBCwAzoHCAAQigUQQzoNCC4QigUQsQMQ1AIQQzoICAAQigUQkQI6DQgAEIoFELEDEIMBEEM6CggAEIoFELEDEEM6BggAEAcQHjoOCAAQigUQsQMQgwEQkQI6CggAEA0QgAQQsQM6DQgAEA0QgAQQsQMQsQM6BwgAEA0QgAQ6CAgAEAUQBxAeOggIABAIEAcQHjoICAAQBRAeEA06CAgAEAgQHhANOgoIIRCgARDDBBAKSgQIQRgAUK0DWO0tYOYvaAFwAXgBgAF6iAH9FJIBBDI2LjSYAQCgAQHIAQjAAQE&sclient=gws-wiz-serp&ibp=htl;jobs&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi334TI19D-AhXBFzQIHej7CWQQudcGKAF6BAgMECo#fpstate=tldetail&htivrt=jobs&htidocid=W9hDwbNYoCkAAAAAAAAAAA%3D%3D)) will also often have a result box where you can see specific job details.

> _Some internship-specific sites are specific to a single country, so check where the roles are based before you start searching._

Often, general job-search sites like Talent.com and Indeed have country-specific sites where you can find roles that are based near you.

- Talent.com has different sites in [Kenya](https://ke.talent.com/jobs), [Ghana](https://gh.talent.com/jobs), and [Nigeria](https://ng.talent.com/jobs).
- Indeed also has a country-specific site for [Nigeria](https://ng.indeed.com/jobs). 

You can also find listings for virtual internships on other job search sites, like these listings for [Computer Science](https://www.internships.com/computer-science/virtual) or [Data Science](https://www.internships.com/data-science/virtual) from Internships.com.

### How to search on job platforms

**Try different combinations of keywords**

"software internship" might show different results as "software engineer internship" or "developer intern". Try each of the combinations that might be relevant to you.

**Use the filtering tools**

Select your city or enter "Remote" for the location to filter for only positions that are near you. Depending on the platform, you can try other filters to only see jobs that are relevant to you.

**Keep a list**

Keep track of the links of the companies and roles you want to apply to. For your assignment, you will need to keep a tracker with all the jobs you have applied to. You can use that to track the companies you intend to apply to as well.

**Switch platforms**

If it feels like you have run out of options on one job search platform, you might find different positions on a different platform. Try switching to another tool and trying your luck there.
